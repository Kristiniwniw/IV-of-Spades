         <h3>Verse 1:</h3>
         <p>I love you<br>
         But I don't really show you<br>
         I'd call you<br>
         But only if you want me too<br>
         Oh, don't you let it stop Oh,<br>
         I won't let it happen, baby<br>
         I will never stop<br>

        </p>

         <p>Come inside of my heart<br>
         If you're looking for answers<br>
         Look at the stars, go a little bit faster<br>
         Ooh, ooh, hooh-ahh-ooh<br>
         Come inside of my heart<br>
         If you're looking for answers<br>

         Forgive me if I hurt you<br>
         Come save me<br>
         'Cause you're the only one for me<br>
         Oh, don't you let it stop<br>
         Oh, I won't let it happen, baby<br>
         I will never stop<br>
         But only if you listen to me<br>
